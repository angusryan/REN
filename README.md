# REN (React Emergency Notification)

*Under Development*

An emergency button designed as a wristband for the elderly to (*REACT*) press in the event of an accident (*Emergency*), notifying (*Notification*) family or nursing home staff via an app that an incident has occured.

The wristband will be connected to the internet via WiFi, when the button is pressed in the event of an emergency a ping will be sent up to a server, which will trigger a notification to be displayed on any family members or/and staff mobiles.

  # The Hardware

  *MVP*
  - Particle Photon
  - Push Button (undecided on particular button but will test a collection)
  - Coin Battery for power 


  *Production Circuit*
  - ESP8266/Particle P1 (undecided)
  - Push Button (subject to change) 
  - Rechargable LiPo Battery

 # The Software
 
 The Software will be developed in C/C++ for the firmware and most probably the app will be developed in Java (possibly Kotlin yet to       decide).
